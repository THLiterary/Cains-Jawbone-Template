At my meeting with Clement yesterday, he had been quite specific: less than twenty thousand yards as average-seventeen thousand and six hundred to be exact-full ration of the assassin's wonderful substance, a little act of justice at the end of less than a week, and then the glorious stuff galore for ever. I felt excellent as I took my second pill. At least I was on my way, for I had come upon the major half of a Hodder & Stoughton ; they had always been very good to me, what with Austin Freeman, Oppenheim, and Mary Roberts Rinehart. O my mother was loath to have her go away, all the week she thought of her, she watched her for many a month. And then there was a forgotten line. But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again. I thought it a pity that Hodder was not there: what a sweet name for a village! My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes. No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair. I have no chair.
