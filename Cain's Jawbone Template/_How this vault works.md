- There's folders in the left sidebar for [[Events]], [[Narrator(s)]], [[Pages]], [[People]], [[Places]] and Templates. 
---

- [[Events]] - I highly recommend you put the double brackets around any events you think are significant, add the pages to this folder and make your notes via the [[Events_Template]]
- [[Narrator(s)]] - Follow the [[Narrator_Template]] to fill out details about who the narrator is, what clued you into their pages, and any other significant details here. Not all sections will be relevant to all potential narrators though, so be warned!
- [[Pages]] - this is a folder containing all of the pages in the novel with passages and including space for notes on various things like events, locations, narrator, literature etc. ^465276
- [[People]] - a space to collect information about people! Similar to how narrators work but this is for when you're not sure if a character is a narrator or not. 
- [[Places]] - works similar to events. I highly recommend that you put brackets around any places mentioned in the text and fill in details that could help you.
- The templates section is to use with Obsidian and includes templates for narrators, people, places, events and pages.
